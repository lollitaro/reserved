					<h3>An Ever Young Community</h3>
					<p>Pull&Bear started up in 1991 with a clear international mission and with the intention of dressing young people who are engaged with their environment, who live in the community and relate to each other. Young people who have a casual dress sense, who shun stereotypes and who want to feel good in whatever they are wearing.</p>
					<p>Pull&Bear evolves at the same pace as its customer, always watching out for new technologies, social movements and the latest artistic or musical trends. All of this can be seen reflected not only in its designs but also in stores. Inspired by the legendary Californian city of Palm Springs, the product lines are constantly being updated. All stores worldwide receive new merchandise twice a week.</p>

					<h3>Collections</h3>
					<p>Pull&Bear brings the latest international trends to the street in the form of easy, comfortable and casual clothes. The Pull&Bear collections are conceived with the idea of dressing men and women with a young mindset, taking into account that age is not an obstacle when choosing our wardrobe.</p>
					<p>The second line is directed at more adult male and female consumers who have grown up with the brand. For them Pull&Bear creates garments that are inspired by the latest international trends for both daytime and evening wear, and that can be worn at work and during leisure time. This line adapts these trends to the needs of Pull&Bear customers, making them more relaxed and turning them into easy-to-wear garments.</p>
					<p>The textile collection is backed up by the footwear, accessory, jewellery, fragrance, headphones, longskates and sunglasses lines.</p>
